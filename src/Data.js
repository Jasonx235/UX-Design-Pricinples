      "UX design principles are the building blocks to intuitive interactions between the user and the product/service. Don Norman, the pioneer of modern UX design philosophies, formulated six design principles in his book The Design of Everyday Things. These design principles are incorporated into our daily lives from the doors we use to enter rooms to the apps on our smartphones. This website was designed to demonstrate the six principles of design using simple and interactive modules so that anyone can learn how each principle influences the design process.",

    description:
      "Affordance is the principle that allows users to instinctively know what actions can be taken. You should be able to intuitively act without having to think about it. The most basic example of this principle is doors, when you see a door with a handle you instinctively try to pull the door, and when there is a flat surface you think to push. ",

    description:
      "Consistency is the principle that is concerned with the overall uniformity of the aesthetics and functionality of a certain product/service. Having a consistent look and feel across your service/brand allows the user to have a sense of familiarity and reliability. Google has a consistent theme throughout all of its products and services.",

    description:
      "Constraint is the principle that restricts users from performing certain actions. All actions should not be available to the user at all times because they will always do things that werenâ€™t intended, by limiting options for the users you can protect them from unintended errors.",

      "Feedback is the principle that notifies the user that an action has been acknowledged and what the next steps are. There are many forms of feedback: visual, audio, tactile, etc. Each is used depending on the context in which they are needed. Let's say you are completing a purchase and press the confirm button, you want some feedback in the manner of a message to confirm that your order was placed.",

    description:
      "Mapping is the principle that refers to the relationship between the actions you perform on a controller and the expected reaction. A well-designed product/service will not need labels to indicate the functionality because the mapping was clear.  An example of unclear mapping is the stove in your kitchen, there are four burners played out in a square pattern and four knobs in a row. Without having labels on each knob it would be difficult to discern which knob turns on which burner.",

Examples of visual aids would be large call-to-action buttons on home pages that allow you to view important content.",
